# 724 Reverse
Write a program which has no input (i.e., contains no input statement â€” read, readln, scanf, fget,
...) and displays a copy of its source program code in order, immediately followed by its source code in
reverse. The resulting output will be a palindrome, except that carriage-return line-feed sequences are
not reversed.
